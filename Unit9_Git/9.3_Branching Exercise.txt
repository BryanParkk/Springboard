Part I

- What **_git_** command creates a branch?
  : git branch {Branch Name}

- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
  : fast forward is commit last files, recursive mergis is going to make another branch

- What **_git_** command changes to another branch?
  : git branch -m {name for another branch}

- What **_git_** command deletes a branch?
  : git branch -d {name for delete branch}
